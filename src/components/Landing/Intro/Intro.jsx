                    When the la-la hits ya lyrics just splits ya
                    Head so hard, that your hat can't fit you
                    Either I'm with ya or against ya
                    Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
                    Talking to the rap inventor
                    Ninja with the game tight, fifth of that flame right
                    Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
                    Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo</h4>
